Added: Medical system - NEW WIP
New modular and scalable medical system (need to place the MCC medical system module) the medical system is built around blood level where a player loses a lot of blood he will eventually die. 
Features:
- Complex or plain: in complex mod players will need more items to heal such as epipen, bandages, first aid kits, saline bags and more. Where in the non-complex mod, players will use ArmA 3 default gear such as FAIK and Medikits.
- Medical system will work on AI and players where AI will sometimes regain consciousness so verifying a kill is now needed. 
- Bleeding, players and AI can bleed to death either while alive or unconscious, bandaging will only stop the bleeding but will not regain blood level. Blood level will regain over long periods of time and can be increased to a degree by addressing saline transfusions. 
- Unconscious effects for players and AI. 
- Bleeding effects vary from blurry vision, lower stamina, fading and color blind - depends on the amount of blood lost. 
- Body armor - mission maker can adjust the effectiveness of body armors by adjusting it effects on players.  
- Team kill punish - Where a player got killed by a friendly player he can ask to punish that player - if mission maker allows. 
- MEDIVAC - since blood loose regain slowly it is vital to get the mortally wounded players to the MCC side start location to fasten the blood regain and heal major wounds.

Added: Shared cargo and valor system - NEW
As part of the expending WIP RTS element of the commander console new buildings have been added such as: Medical area, Medical Lab, Diesel generator, solar power panels' exc. So far you can only fool around by building these buildings as of now they aren't functional yet. 
But in the basic version of the H.Q (Start location) and the 2 upgraded version of it (Radio tower and Sat-coms) I've added shared cargo box in the entrance to the HQ. 
The shared cargo box allows players to drop items they don't need or resources they have found using the survival option to gain valor points and resources points. 
Valor points can be used to withdraw items from the shared cargo but there is a catch, withdrawing an item will always cost more valor points then deposit it so at the end players are encouraged to give to the community more then they take.
 KEEP IN MIND this is a WIP and this is my playground so if you don't like it just skip it and never activate the survival option. For those who do want to explore it keep in mind that this is my take on ArmA 3 campaign and according to my Interpretation I would love to make a resistance game mode where a group of players struggle with minimum gear to regain resources and control over the island while fighting Opfor AI and rival players driven faction.
